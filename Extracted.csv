Components were found to be insufficiently robust, the LSW's bipod lock often failed to hold the bipod legs in closed position, the plastic furniture was melted by insect repellent, metal parts were quick to rust in jungle environments, and the weapon's mechanism was highly susceptible to dusty and arctic environments. As a result, a more extensive modification programme was executed. In 2000, a team, led by Ernst Mauch, was contracted to upgrade the SA80 family of weapons. 200,000 SA80s were re-manufactured for £400 each, producing the A2 variant.<newline><newline><style MMOptionEntry>Made in England <image UI/Icons/Flags/f_england.dds 1600>}",,3,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The user had to carry a transformer backpack powered by a battery fitted inside the gas mask canister.

However, the high cost of the weapon, complex and time-consuming machining, combined with a limited effective range, large size and weight for a pistol, fragile buttstock, frequent stoppages and subpar ergonomics, led to the APS being gradually phased out of active service.

The army wanted to replace these weapons with modern designs of preferable Belgian origin. The Vigneron is a simple blowback design and was made out of stamped sheet metal and a plastic grip frame. It uses the standard 9×19mm NATO round out of a 32-shot double-column, single-feed, box magazine. Army doctrine recommends to shortload the magazine to 28 rounds to prevent failures. A box type loading tool is used to assist loading the magazine.<newline><newline>Influence by some popular WW-II-era designs is apparent. The ""Cutts"" type barrel compensator and cooling rings are reminiscent of the Thompson submachine gun, the wire stock looks like the M3 submachine gun, the bolt design is nearly identical to the Sten and the magazine is almost the same as the one designed for the MP40.

Gus' officially appears for the first time in Deadly Games as a non-player character who hires the commander to perform a series of missions, eventually culminating in a takedown of terrorist organization DFK.

If there's room in the team, Gus will join your merc squad on the very last mission to take on the DFK in their own headquarters. He carries with him high stats all around with the exception of a slightly subpar agility and medical skill, high level gear (to match the gear the squad has undoubtedly accumulated at this point) and joins for free. He performs the entire mission with a huge smile on his face, no matter what's going on. Evidently he really meant it when he said he wanted to get onto the field.

Jagged Alliance/Deadly Games
Having ruined his health with drugs, Larry loses rather than gains stats at the end of a day, a trait normally reserved to old mercs.

Jagged Alliance 2

Larry has two different personalities - clean and relapsed. After hiring, he can relapse under certain conditions, losing a lot of stat points, making him almost useless.

As long as he stays clean he's the sociable sort, and loves to hang around other mercs (with some exceptions). However, once relapsed he loses focus and becomes forgetful, preferring the loner lifestyle.

Relapse conditions

Stationary passing time while assigned to squad, carrying energy booster, regeneration booster, medical kit, or any type of alcohol. First aid kits are excluded.

Stationary passing time while assigned to squad, carrying none of the above items, in any city sector that has a bar.
The easiest way to prevent a relapse while carrying any of the above items, is keeping Larry busy, assigning him to squad only to travel and fight. And even though sleeping whilst assigned to squad (eg. after travelling) would be safe, there's no wake-up call and Larry's very quick to get his hands on something ""groovy"".

Getting clean

Luckily there's an easy way to get him clean. A one day speed course called ""walkabout"". Within a short while, needing a rest at least once, he's as fit as a fiddle again. As mentioned above, carrying any of the ""relapse triggering items"" isn't a problem per se, just keep a very close tab on him waking up.

Due to strength loss, Larry can be severely encumbered while on the ""walkabout"" and damage his strength and/or health. Damaged strength will be temporary and reset as soon as he's clean, even though it still looks red for a short while. Damaged health will be permanent until dismissed! Dismissing him will reset health back to what it was.",,,,,,

The organization wishes him the best of luck in all his future endeavors.""

JA2 MERC:

Roachburn has recently spent six months at an exclusive and classy rehab center undergoing treatment. Having completed the program, he proclaims himself cured and ready for duty.

Additional Info:Larry spent most of his spare time in rehab studying pharmacology which has tremendously improved his medical knowledge.""

Additional Info

Larry's drug habits have made him forgetful, and he will often stop in the middle of a task in need of a reminder, losing AP.
His brother Gary derisively refers to him as ""Anything But A Placebo"" Larry.

Jagged Alliance/Deadly Games
Having ruined his health with drugs, Larry loses rather than gains stats at the end of a day, a trait normally reserved to old mercs.

Jagged Alliance 2

Larry has two different personalities - clean and relapsed. After hiring, he can relapse under certain conditions, losing a lot of stat points, making him almost useless.

As long as he stays clean he's the sociable sort, and loves to hang around other mercs (with some exceptions). However, once relapsed he loses focus and becomes forgetful, preferring the loner lifestyle.

Relapse conditions

Stationary passing time while assigned to squad, carrying energy booster, regeneration booster, medical kit, or any type of alcohol. First aid kits are excluded.

Stationary passing time while assigned to squad, carrying none of the above items, in any city sector that has a bar.
The easiest way to prevent a relapse while carrying any of the above items, is keeping Larry busy, assigning him to squad only to travel and fight. And even though sleeping whilst assigned to squad (eg. after travelling) would be safe, there's no wake-up call and Larry's very quick to get his hands on something ""groovy"".

Getting clean

Luckily there's an easy way to get him clean. A one day speed course called ""walkabout"". Within a short while, needing a rest at least once, he's as fit as a fiddle again. As mentioned above, carrying any of the ""relapse triggering items"" isn't a problem per se, just keep a very close tab on him waking up.

Due to strength loss, Larry can be severely encumbered while on the ""walkabout"" and damage his strength and/or health. Damaged strength will be temporary and reset as soon as he's clean, even though it still looks red for a short while. Damaged health will be permanent until dismissed! Dismissing him will reset health back to what it was.",true,,,,,

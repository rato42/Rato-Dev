The weapon is colloquially known as OC-14 or OTs-14 ""Groza"". The OTs-14-4A ""Groza-4"" has one derivative, the TKB-0239 (ТКБ-0239), also known as OTs-14-1A ""Groza-1"", chambered for the 7.62×39mm cartridge.

The Groza saw limited use in 1999 in the Second Chechen War, however they quickly fell out of favour and are no longer produced.

Some StG 44s were fitted with the Zielgerät 1229 infra-red aiming device, also known by its codename Vampir (""vampire""). This device consisted of a large scope, rather like modern starlight scopes, and a large infra-red lamp on top, the scope being able to pick up the infra-red that would be invisible to the naked eye. The user had to carry a transformer backpack powered by a battery fitted inside the gas mask canister. Electric cables connected the power unit with the IR reflector, with the cathode ray tube mounted on the rifle imaging IR from the spotlight. The Vampir had only 15 minutes of battery life, but was able to sight within 200 meters in total darkness.
